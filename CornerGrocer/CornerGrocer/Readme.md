# 7-3 Project Three Submission - Corner Grocer Grocery List Analysis

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project's goal is to create a menu which allows the user to analyze a list of grocery items by querying the document for the frequency of an item. While the program analyzes word frequencies of the input file, it must write an output file featuring a list and respective frequencies for these grocery keywords.
I did well in relation to building the menu. I think I laid my structure out well and did a good job defining my class for the menu. I could improve by adding more generic functions so that the code isn't so redundant in all my menu functions, and I could make all my menu functions read from the pre-parsed Frequency.dat file for greater efficiency. This might also help code security. 
I found the most difficult code to be the error checking code, specifically handling if a user input while an int was expected not giving an int. I could not overcome this, despite trying to take advantage of resources such as programming forums. I should keep a C++ documentation more handy in the future. 
I think all of my projects this semester have contributed to my programming toolbox. This project was good practice for reading and writing files as well as building a class from the ground up. These are skills I'll be relying on as my courses become more and more major focused.
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by centralizing globals in my main file, delegating functions to classes that act as libraries, and commenting and using white space to organize and describe the code as I wrote it.
This was a very good and productive project.
