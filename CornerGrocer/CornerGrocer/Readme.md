    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project's goal is to create a menu which allows the user to analyze a list of grocery items by querying the document for the frequency of an item. While the program analyzes word frequencies of the input file, it must write an output file featuring a list and respective frequencies for these grocery keywords.
