Create a menu:
1) Find occurences in a list document
Prompt the user to input a query for an item or word to search for in a document. 
Return the value of the frequency of that word.


2) Print a list with numbers of occurences: The frequency of each item with a corresponding number.
Potatoes 4
Pumpkins 5
Onions 3

3) Print the frequency of each item in the form of a histogram
This is a diagram of rectangles with areas proportional to frequency
Print the name 
Potatoes ****
Pumpkins *****
Onions ***

4) Quit the program


This app should create a frequency.dat file to back up the frequency data. It should include every unique item key paired with the times appeared in the input file.

Create a documentation describing design and functionality including screenshots of the code and functionality. Include thought process as coding.

The implementation must include at least one class with public and private sections.
